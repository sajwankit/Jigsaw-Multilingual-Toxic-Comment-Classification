the original 2018 competition, and Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification, which required the competitors to consider biased ML predictions in their
new models.This year, the goal is to use english only training data to run toxicity predictions on many different languages,
which can be done using multilingual models, and speed up using TPUs.
